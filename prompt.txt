I have a downloaded course related to web development
Here are the video subtitle chunks containing video title, 
video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:
[{"id":0,"start":0.0,"end":7.0,"text":"Now to design the player, first of all, let's set the size of our icons, which are my player control icons."},{"id":33,"start":166.0,"end":170.0,"text":"We are going to give display flex to our player controls."},{"id":78,"start":313.0,"end":318.0,"text":"So in this way, we have set our player control and its icons."},{"id":58,"start":258.0,"end":263.0,"text":"And this center icon, we will increase its size a little earlier with the help of inline styling."},{"id":32,"start":163.0,"end":166.0,"text":"That is, our player controls, let me highlight it for you."}]
----------------------------------------------
"Where can I find resizing of player control icons"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer where and how much content is taught where 
is taught in which video (in which video at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video.
If user asks an unrelated question, tell him you can answer only according to the course.
Just answer the question concisely, precisely with accuracy don't give follow up questions
